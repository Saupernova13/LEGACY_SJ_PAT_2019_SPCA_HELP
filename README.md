# LEGACY_SJ_PAT_2019_SPCA_HELP
By Sauraav Jayrajh

This is a repository for the files of my old highschool IT PAT (10th Grade). I was tasked with making an application to assist the SPCA in it's daily operations. 
 
Tab 1: Gave the user information about the SPCA as an organisation and displayed the logo.

Tab 2: Informed the user of all other tabs and their functionalities, aswell as introduced 3 ways to traverse the application:

- By the tabe selection from the top of the application
- By the "Next" and "Previous" buttons on the lower corners
- By the large, illustrated options on the 2nd tab. (This was made incase users missed the other 2 options, or were visually impared.)

Tab 3: Allowed the user to register an animal with the organisation. After all details were filled in, the data would be saved to a text file for recording purposes.

Tab 4: Allowed the user to register a volunteer with the organisation. After all details were filled in, the data would be saved to a text file for recording purposes.

Tab 5: Featured a calculator. The user would be allowed to enter in a first value and second value by clicking on the numbers onscreen, then selecting an operation to perform on them so a result can be shown.

Tab 6: Featured a Q&A section on how to use the application, directly to the user.
